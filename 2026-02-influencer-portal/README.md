Nice 😄 that’s exciting.

What kind of coding project is it?
If you want, you can tell me:

the tech stack (web, mobile, backend, etc.)

your role (UI, logic, backend, full-stack)

what stage it’s in (idea, half-built, fixing bugs)

I can help you:

plan the architecture

break it into tasks

set up the repo & folder structure

write or review code

debug issues as you go

Whenever you’re ready, drop the details and we’ll build it step by step 🚀

this is a vue.js project. its a public facing website. and it has a html caching service. the backend is airtable with a data cache layer. the website is for an art dealer client in cape town called origin art.. the component library is quasar. we have a strict rule to use inline stlyes and utility classes only (no style blocks). the project is in the process of being launch. any futher work will just be fine tuning basically. nothing major.
