## NativeLikeValidation — Mission Statement

**NativeLikeValidation** exists to restore the clarity, neatness, and developer ergonomics of native HTML form validation within modern JavaScript applications.

Its mission is to provide a **high-level, declarative validation layer** that matches the usability standards of browser-native validation—immediate visibility, minimal visual disruption, and semantic simplicity—while remaining compatible with SPA, AJAX, and component-based architectures.

NativeLikeValidation prioritizes:

-   **Neat UX** — no layout reflow, no intrusive error blocks by default
-   **Immediate clarity** — all invalid fields are revealed at once on submit
-   **Declarative semantics** — validation rules should read like intent, not plumbing
-   **Framework independence** — usable alongside Vue, Quasar, or plain JavaScript
-   **Explicit control** — no hidden magic, no silent failures

This helper does not attempt to replicate browser APIs or override framework validation systems. Instead, it **reclaims the user experience and developer clarity** that native validation provided, while acknowledging the realities of modern application flows such as asynchronous submission, multi-step forms, and server-side authority.

NativeLikeValidation is designed for developers who value **clarity over cleverness**, **intent over implementation**, and **user confidence over incremental nudging**—especially in high-trust contexts like checkout, onboarding, and data submission.
