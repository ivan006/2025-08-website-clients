Nice 😄 that’s exciting.

What kind of coding project is it?
If you want, you can tell me:

the tech stack (web, mobile, backend, etc.)

your role (UI, logic, backend, full-stack)

what stage it’s in (idea, half-built, fixing bugs)

I can help you:

plan the architecture

break it into tasks

set up the repo & folder structure

write or review code

debug issues as you go

Whenever you’re ready, drop the details and we’ll build it step by step 🚀
